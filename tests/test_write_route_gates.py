"""Proves the three write routes that used to bypass the authz gate entirely
now go through it (card 9d37d53d).

BEFORE this card, ``POST /api/card/{id}/{action}``, ``POST /api/cmdb/seed`` and
``POST /api/models/advertise`` reached the coordination store, the CMDB, and
skgateway's advertise allowlist without ever consulting ``queue_authz``. Their
only control was the ``127.0.0.1`` bind, so any process able to open the
loopback port could mutate the board or the fleet's model catalog. The queue and
change.* routes were already gated; these three simply were not wired in.

Invariants proved here:
  1. With the gate configured (``SKAI_QUEUE_TOKEN`` set) and no/wrong
     capability, each of the three routes returns 403 AND its underlying
     side effect never runs.
  2. With the right capability, each route proceeds and does its work.
  3. With NEITHER ``SKAI_AUTHZ`` nor ``SKAI_QUEUE_TOKEN`` set, each route still
     works. This is the deployed loopback-open state on the live seat, and this
     card must not change it.
  4. Registry sweep: EVERY POST route registered on the app carries one of the
     known gate markers in its handler source. A future POST route added
     without a gate fails this test instead of shipping ungated.

What this file does NOT prove, deliberately: that ``X-SK-Actor`` is
authenticated. It is not. It is a self-asserted header, and closing that hole
belongs to the Unified Consent Plane epic (capauth ``x-sk-capability``), not to
this card. See SECURITY.md.
