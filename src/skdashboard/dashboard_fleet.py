"""Dashboard Fleet Drift view: install-profile drift, per node, fleet wide.

Epic 3bbf39ea, card d1c6d605. This module is the dashboard's surface over
``skfleet node doctor --all``: it reads each node's published
``status.inventory`` from the files-as-API fleet tree and grades it against
that node's install profile. No ssh, no host access, and no actuation verb
anywhere in this file.

The grading itself is NOT implemented here. ``skcapstone.fleet.cli._doctor_one``
is the fleet's one grader and this panel calls it directly, private name and
all. That coupling is deliberate: a second copy of "who gets graded and how"
would eventually disagree with the CLI, and an operator comparing the panel
against ``skfleet node doctor`` would have no way to tell which one lied.

Severity grading is inherited from ``profile_doctor`` and must not be
flattened by the presentation layer:

    forbidden        error  the node is doing something it was told not to
    missing_required warn   the node has not finished becoming what it is
    unexpected       info   the manifest has not caught up with reality

Only the error grade alerts. Grading the noisy categories as errors is how a
signal turns into wallpaper everyone learns to ignore.

A node with no role, or one that has published no inventory, renders as an
explicit SKIPPED state carrying its reason. It is neither clean nor drifted:
an absent inventory is not an observation of an empty machine, and treating
it as one grades a healthy node as missing everything.

No em/en dashes anywhere (SKWorld hard rule).
